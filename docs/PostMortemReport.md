Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

* Good general organization of the team
* remote meetings distributed among them correctly during development
* meetings organized only when needed
* satisfied time zone of each member for communication of any kind
* good distribution of skills in the project

# Worst things

* split of tasks not always done uniformly between members of team
* reduce delivery time of each deliverable by starting to split tasks earlier
* start tasks earlier in order that other team members are able to help in time
* synchronize progress between members

# Suggestions 

* find and use other tools for communicating with other members of the team in case of problems (tool server doesn't work in certain areas in the world, VPN problems for using a tool)
* distribuite time for each activity more correctly on basis of the project
